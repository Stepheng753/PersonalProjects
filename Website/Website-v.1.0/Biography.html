			<h2>Education and its role in my Life</h2>
			<p>
				From an early age, my parents always made education a very huge emphasis in my life. Luckily, I have been blessed with great teachers that made
				learning exciting and fun. I learned very quickly, that math was a subject I was very adept in. I continued to excel in school all the way up
				until high school. In my freshman and sophomore year, certain events regarding family disorder took the importance of school from me. This is
				where I began to fall in my coursework. After going through these events, however, I came out as a very much stronger and better person. I began
				to really piece my future together from this point. Beginning my junior year, I was able to get my very first job, where I was working 30 hours
				a week (full time for minors). During this time, I was also taking AP Calculus I. My favorite and best teacher that I have ever had, Mr. Leven,
				gave me and other students an opportunity that has changed my life for the better. Through his endless support and help, we were allowed to
				independently study for the AP Calc II test, whilst enrolled in Calc I. By passing this test, I was able to take college level math
				(Multivariable Calculus and Elementary Linear Algebra) during my senior year of high school. Not only did this allow me to get a lot of college
				coursework out of the way, it also helped me realize exactly the opportunities that were always in front of me, and to find out exactly what I
				was capable of as long as I was determined enough. To pass this test, I studied endlessly until the test date came. I studied before school, in
				between school and work, and after work that ended at 10pm. Because of my lower GPA from failing classes in the beginning of college, I was
				rejected from the universities I had applied to. However, I decided to make the best of my situation, and go to my local community college and
				transfer to SDSU in a single year out of high school. From taking the college math courses in high school, I only needed to complete my general
				education to transfer. My first semester at San Diego Miramar College, I took 24 units (twice the amount for full time). I also took a course at
				Grossmont College for a total of 28 units that semester, while working part time at StateFarm and doing tutoring. Now I am currently attending
				SDSU, where I am keeping a GPA that will hopefully allow me to graduate with Magna Cum Laude. At SDSU, I have started a Computer Science Minor
				along with my Mathematics Major with an emphasis in Computational Science. From my experience with independently learning, I am also pursing
				learning more computer programming online. I am pursing independently learning about machine learning, hacking, and becoming a Full Stack
				Developer. The education doesn't stop however. I am planning on completing a Physics AS at San Diego Miramar College in 2022. From there, I know
				I will continuously be enrolled in school to continuously keep learning new things.

			<h2>Friends and its role in my Life</h2>
			<p>
				My family situation has never been the best. I find a lot of my comfort in my friends. Friends have always been there for me when I need them.
				This is kind of my Thank You to them. I have found my closest friends in some of the weirdest places. The friends that I think of as family are
				actually my co-workers from my night shifts at McDonald's. I truly love them as much as a person can love their family. My other friend group
				comes from some friends when I was on my high school's dance team. We had all danced together and still all stay connected in our busy lives to
				enjoy game nights, or for some dinner parties.Lastly, my last friend group are some great people I met whilst at SDSU. I loved our long nights
				studying at the SDSU love library. I have definitely been through the toughest classes and homework with these friends, and I hope our
				friendship lasts after college.

			<h2>Money and its role in my Life</h2>
			<p>
				Money has played a very active role in my life. Growing up, my family didn't have that much money, so we had to cut back on the luxuries of life
				a lot. It was the little things I think as a kid, that made me want money so much. For example, in school, I was always hungry because school
				lunch was never enough food. I never had snacks or lunch from home to keep me fueled. I remember always asking other students to share their
				food with me. I also remember the time, where on field trips, everyone always had Lunchables and I always had a bologna sandwich. Or just during
				recess, everyone had pokemon cards, and my dad would never buy me them. Another thing, I wanted so badly as a kid was either birthday money,
				Christmas money, or allowance money. Going into middle and high school, I remember never having money to go eat out with my friends. Its funny
				to think back and see all the things I wanted so badly as a kid. But these little memories is what drives me to getting to a state of financial
				independence. I never want to have opportunities closed because of a lack of money. I want to be able to live worry free of the thought of
				whether or not I have enough money. I got my very first "job" at the age of 14, cutting a neighbor's yard, and then I house sat at another
				neighbor's house for a few holidays. The instant I turned 16, I got a job at McDonald's and truly experienced what it was like to have a full
				time job and be able to go out and eat, or buy cool tech stuff on Amazon. From there, I have had jobs at StateFarm, Tutor Doctor, and Spa
				Synergy. Pretty much from the 2016 to 2019, I was working a full time job, being a full time student, and tutoring at nights. This year (2020),
				I have decided to take a pause on the jobs to truly focus on finishing my degree. I do however, expect to fully dive back into the work field in
				2021. Through all that hard work, I had saved about $20,000. Throughout highschool, I had been trying to independently learn about the Stock
				Market. This year, I started trading in the Stock Market, where I put $6,000 in an individual brokerage account and another $6,000 into a ROTH
				IRA. Using Schwab Intelligent Portfolios, my retirement plan has made about $550. Buying my own stocks, my individual account has made about
				$1,500. Understanding about money, I know the importance of investing at an early age, and especially starting a retirement plan as early as
				possible. I have been trying so hard to be smart with my money, all for one very big goal, to be a San Diego Home Owner by 2023 - 2025. From
				there, my goals will be to open up my own tutoring business, "Crossroads Tutoring", and to travel to two countries a year.
