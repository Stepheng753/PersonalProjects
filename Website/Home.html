			<h2>Welcome to my Very First Website!</h2>
			<p id="Intro">
				Hi! My Name is Stephen Giang. I have built this from scratch using HTML, JS, CSS, and PHP. I am a
				student at SDSU majoring in Mathematics with an emphasis in Computational Science and a minor in
				Computer Science. I am expected to graduate in May 2021. Originally through my coursework, I have
				learned back end developing through languages such as Java, Python, C++, Matlab, and more. I went ahead
				and took the initiative to learn front end developing using videos taught on
				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="blank">Youtube</a> from a channel called
				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/derekbanas" target="blank">Derek Banas</a>. I am also learning
				about visualization and machine learning using JavaScript by another Youtuber,
				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman" target="blank">The Coding Train</a>. I am making this
				website to hopefully broadcast my passion for learning and to display my coding to any future employers
				or anyone interested. My goal career wise is to be a software engineer for a company that focuses on
				mathematical application. An example of topics in which I am very much interested would be the science
				of autonomous vehicles such as drones or cars. The sensors needed for that is what I would greatly want
				to be involved in as I am very much interested in Computer Vision. Currently, I have joined a team
				called StreetsMart. Here, we are building a social networking app based around travel. This will be an
				app that will allow its users to truly connect to others, and share their experience around the world. I
				am currently learning React Native, MySQL, and more to assist as much as I can in this team.
